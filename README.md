# UDP Communicator
## (Client-Server functionality)

This python program allows you to send files in your local network between devices. 
This was my project for Networking in University, the program can corrupt packet to mimic the outage of your connection to the server, 

and it's based on UDP with additional checks to make it behave more like TCP connection. You can switch between sender(client) and reciever(Server) anytime.

This project helped me understand more deeply how the sockets and network protocols work.
